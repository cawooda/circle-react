      <p>
        Circle Independent creates delightful business solutions for those in
        the caring profession. We undestand that those who help others whether
        through counselling, psychology or other supports need to focus on this
        work, and not on boring stuff like data management and invoicing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thats why we created Circle Independent, so that professionals can focus
        on what matters to them and their customers, while we take care of the
        back end.
